          The purpose of ICC shall be to establish a contingent of Notre Dame
          students interested in and passionate about consulting through the
          coordination of engaging events and consistent development. ICC will
          do so by: A) Organizing formal and informal mentorship opportunities
          that connect Notre Dame upperclassmen with underclassmen interested in
          consulting, B) Establishing project work that allows ICC members to
          develop consulting skill sets while addressing real, meaningful
          problems, C) Educating members about the wide-ranging field of
          consulting and the steps necessary to obtain employment in this field
          through candid conversations with experienced upperclassmen.
